Retail Inventory Management System (Command-Line Interface)

This project is a command-line interface (CLI) system designed to manage the inventory of a retail store. 
It allows users to efficiently perform key inventory tasks, such as adding new products, updating stock quantities, 
checking product availability, and generating sales reports. The system leverages an SQLite database to store product and 
sales information.

Users can interact with the program by entering simple text commands or selecting options from a menu, making it easy to 
manage inventory without needing a graphical user interface. This project is a great solution for small to medium-sized 
retail stores looking for a streamlined, text-based inventory management tool.
